              <p>  “Get that thing away from me!” Sarah yelled. “YOU DID THAT, NOT ME” I said as I screamed at Sarah. “It was an accident, I would never be that stupid to do that,” she said as she wore the gloves she saw on the table. She took the knife from me and opened the cupboard cautiously, without making a sound and putting the knife in the cupboard. She said, “I need you to go inside and make sure that no one comes in? “You know I am an introvert and I don’t like to talk to anyone,” I said as I closed the cupboard Sarah forgot to close. Sarah encouraged me to go, I opened the door and closed the door as soon as I came out. I heard steps from the next cabin. I got scared and nervous.
                The door to the cabin I was in, opened. “Hi, Linda! What are you doing?” said my friend who I knew from the day I joined this company. “We were hearing some screaming noises. I hope all is fine,” said my friend as she grabbed the glass of water that was kept on the table right outside the room. My friend had blonde hair that was neatly tied in a bun, blue eyes that shone in the sunlight. Her outfit was a brown tank top with black jeans, with Adidas shoes and a purse from GUCCI. “ Everything is just fine,” I stuttered and said. “OH well that's great!” she said. As soon as she said that, a lot of noises of things falling down came from the room. I started screaming inside my head and got a panic attack. “ Linda, nothing to worry about. I think it's just the train because it is moving really fast, things are falling” I said as I got a text on my phone. It read, “ All clear”. “You can go inside and check,” I said as my heartbeat started to come back to normal. “Um… No, it's fine. I came to ask you if you wanted to come have some coffee with me?” she said as she looked at me thinking I was a weirdo. “OH sure!! Why not?”I said.
                I walked into the next cabin with my friend. I could smell the sweet aroma of hot coffee. The coffee beans smelled like the cacao beans that I would get from my cottage. The sweet aroma filled the air. The chef took out a batch of fresh, warm and sweet cookies from the oven. I took a seat on the table right beside the window. “2 chocolate cookies with 2 hot coffees please” Olivia ordered. She took a seat right beside me.

          <p>  The chef bought the cookies and the coffee on the tray. “Thank you,” I said as the chef put it on the table. I sipped on my coffee when the cabinet door opened and Sarah walked in. She went to the cooking part of the cabin and ordered something. When she got her order, she walked to us and sat on the chair beside Olivia. We all sat and talked about life and work. Sarah mostly kept quiet. I got to know a lot of things about Sarah and Olivia that I never knew. I finished my cup of coffee and my cookie. I told them that I wanted to go somewhere and I walked out of the cabin. I walked to the cabin where I was assigned to sleep. I lay on my bed feeling guilty for what we did. I had never felt like this before because I had never done this. As soon as the clock struck 9 o clock, a Man walked into my cabin and announced, “ We will be reaching our stop at 10 o'clock, You can change into your uniform clothes if you want to.” After he finished the announcement in my cabin where the incident happened.
            As the clock struck 10, all the people started to walk out of their cabins to the door and everyone came off. Including Sarah, she took a quick glance at me and started walking to Kinfile street. While I walked to Onlenstel street. Why was she acting so weird? What happened to her?? She never even said bye….
       </p>
       <center>   <img src="coffee.jpg" height="200"></center> 
       <p> 
        I walked outside of the station still thinking about the incident. As soon as I reached the hotel, I took my phone out and dialed Sarah’s number. The first time I called, she did not pick up. But the second time, she picked up the phone and talked to me. I asked her what she did with the body, she answered, “ I Burnt it.. I could not think of anything else. Anything did not smell/show because I used the fire chemical we prepared for our project.. I could not speak as I was guilty.” This conversation left a psychological scar on my brain. I will never forget this. I was so shocked that I could not even tell you what happened.
            I removed all my stuff and then I slept. To forget what I did. Do not feel guilty. To not remember ANYTHING. TO just be quiet and keep moving on.

       <p> I looked around the room. Nothing seemed unusual, but then I looked at the missing spot near my window. My ancient vase that was so expensive had been stolen. Who could have done that? I thought to myself. ¨I have never ever let anyone in my room except for my roommate, Jessica¨. It is not like I am an introvert, I just fear that someone would steal something of mine. Sometimes my roommate would let her friends come into our dorm room even though I did not like that. She said that I should talk to people apparently. Right now, the vacations are going on. I wish I had parents, I had lost my parents in an accident when I was 4. I was raised by my grandparents but 1 year ago I joined college. Everyone in their vacations went away to meet their parents, even my roommate. Once she took me to meet her parents too but they were just not my type. My type of parents are strict parents because my grandparents were really strict. The last time I saw my parents we were driving to the way to my grandparents I closed my eyes and BOOM! They were gone, they disappeared into thin air. There was chaos . A woman picked me up and patted me on my back. THen I just blinked and reached my grandparents house. Let's forget it. I don't want to go back in history. I cry whenever I think about it. I got up from my sofa and thought of making dinner. But I did not feel like it, I felt like walking. So I got up and wore my jacket, my hat and gloves and locked the door behind me as I came out.

<p>I walked around my dorm building, when I was finally tired, I checked my mail and guess what I found?? A box of STUFF. It was mailed by …….. My Grandparents?? I quickly took the box and went to my dorm room to see what was inside. I took a knife and tore the box. “What is this?” I asked myself as I took out a little necklace with a picture of someone in Space??? Then I took out a note which read-" Dear Olivia, I hope you are doing well. Today we were Cleaning the house to find some Christmas decorations when we found this box. We gave you 1 box a long time ago and saved this box for now. Remove all the stuff from the box and decorate your dorm room with it. Please write back to us. We really miss you. Bye!!" - Your grandparents. I literally started crying as I read that note. I really miss them but they live in another country so it is impossible for me to visit them. I did not have that much energy to unpack all that stuff so I took my blanket and got ready to sleep. I made sure I locked all the doors so I could not lose any other thing. Ring, Ring, Ring my alarm rang. I woke up and brushed my teeth. I had breakfast and hurried to open the box to take out the stuff and started decorating the room.
    This is where it all ends. I go to college hoping nothing will be stolen, ever again……

<tr> 
    <td width="45%" style="font-size: 90%; vertical-align: top;">
       <p>Kilmore was known for its weird events that happened at random intervals. It used to be very sporadic. People in Kilmore never used to say anything to the government even though they would have boycotted them at any chance they got. The people hated the government. Everyone who came to Kilmore rue their decision. It was just a normal morning in Kilmore Town. Or it was supposed to be. Amor Carline, a doctor, woke up at 7 am. His routine was very simple. Wake up at 7 am, eat oatmeal and a banana for breakfast, drive his car to work, eat a salad there and work. He also was an avid kayaker so sometimes he would go kayaking in the morning. He had to return home before 8 pm as the proprietor of the house locked the doors at 8. But for today his routine changed. At exactly 7:15 am there was an announcement made in all the houses. “Everyone must report to the Grounds Of Kilmore at exactly 8 am” the announcer said. Everyone feared these announcements. They were always bad news. Now Kilmore town was special because all the houses were connected. So you could hear the voice of one person in another house. The government built houses like that so nobody could talk bad about the government. Amor got ready, he knew that today he won't be able to get any work done. He got all dressed up and walked to the ground of Kilmore. Now that he was a doctor, he was a real punctual person and reached there at exactly 7:30 so he wouldn't be late. It was very sparse when he arrived there. But when the clock struck 7:45 a lot of people came in. There were a lot of people and a lot of noise. Suddenly someone jostled against Amor which made him livid. Amor almost fell. Then the clock struck 8 am. A very loud bell rang and the doors to the Grounds Of Kilmore got closed. Everyone became quiet. The mayor of Kilmore walked on to the stage. 2 bodyguards dressed in black followed her. Everyone clapped for her as she walked on the stage. The mayor, Eugine Dalton was the most elegant and talented lady of the town. She was known for her extraordinary capabilities. Even though everyone hated her, she played a pivotal role in the development of Kilmore. At the end of the day she was the one who made spontaneous rules and decisions. Eugine walked towards the microphone making a click-clack noise with her heels. She was wearing a dress falling right below her knees. The dress was made out of the finest silk and was a cattleya purple dress. She was wearing gloves that matched her white hat. The crowd went quiet when she cleared her throat. “Good morning to all my fellow Kilmorians. I hope you all are doing well. Today as we all know is Wednesday, Fourth week of September, 8:17 am. I know you all are wondering why I have-'' she was cut off by a chatter in the crowd. “Seems like someone likes to talk over me” she said sharply, blaring her eyes at the girl. The girl puts her head down. That normally meant she was sorry. “Please amplify the volume of the microphone, some people just can't seem to hear me” she said while emphasizing on the girl to make her feel guiltty. “So as I was saying you might be wondering why I ordered you guys to come here. I want to try a new thing.” she said. Amor became inquisitive.

    <p>He thought ‘What has she thought of now’. “My new idea is that CRIME IS ALLOWED FOR 48 HOURS STARTING FROM TOMORROW!!” she said with great zest. “What is wrong with her, what she's saying is completely ludicrous?” Amor said to the person next to him. The person next to him just shrugged. There was great turmoil. Everyone bemoaned and tried to change Eugine’s mind which was nearly impossible “Everyone can start dispersing the Grounds” she said. It was an etiquette in Kilmore to leave in order. The back people left first and then the rest. Amor left with a lot of hate for Eugine in his mind. He walked to his house and got ready to go to work. He sat in his car and drove to work. At the hospital, all the nurses were talking about the news. Amor walked into his office room. He checked and realized he had no appointments today. He pulled out all the reports he had to finish and send to his patients. He decided to first go meet his patients. They did not know about the news. So Amor explained “The government decreed that crime will be allowed for 48 hours”. All of their expressions were pretty overt. They were all very extremely mad at Eugine except for one guy. The one guy who thought that was frivolous just laughed and said it probably was a joke. He was new to Kilmore. “You might think it's a joke, we all did but when you will see what happens tomorrow, then you'll realize it's not funny” Amor said. All the patients corroborated that fact. Then Amor finished his work and went back home. It was 7:48 pm. He had not eaten dinner. He made himself some pasta and sat down to eat. He went into deep thought.What was going to happen tomorrow. He knew it was not going to be safe to get out of the house tomorrow. He immediately got up and checked if he had food to survive for the next 2 days. Thankfully he did. Then he thought about what he was going to do about work. He decided the safest option would be to act sick and call in a sick day. He called the hospital and said he was sick and he needed to rest for a day. After finishing dinner it was almost 8:30 pm. He locked the doors and closed the windows and went to sleep. He was woken up by a loud noise. He checked the time, it was 1:07. He quickly got up and checked what the noise was. He looked through the window and saw his homeowners home was getting broken into. The person had a gun in his hand. The homeowner relinquished because he did not have any weapon. The person shot him and Amor knew his house was next. Amor quickly called the police but the police rebuffed when he said that they would come to the house and arrest the murderer. The police officer reminded him that it was officially after 12, which meant crime was allowed. At first he was a bit vague when he first heard that. That's when Amor remembered crime was allowed. He went to his kitchen and grabbed a knife just in case. He moved a table in front of the door to make sure no one breaks in. He already knew this was going to be very hard. He knew he had to escape. Amor quietly crept to the secret room in the washroom. He never told anyone about it. He quietly hid there and decided he would spend the night there. He woke up at 6 am. He did not realize when he slept. He got up and checked if anyone was in his house. The table was still in front of his door. There was no one in his house. Or that's what he thought. He walked down the stairs to the kitchen. Trying to omit any noise, he made himself an easy breakfast. That's when a person comes out of the kitchen and shoots him. That's how the story ends. Amor dies and this goes on.</p>

       <p> The show started at exactly 7 pm. All the guests started sitting in their seats. Everyone was so excited for the show to start. A man in a suit appeared on the stage. “Good evening everyone, and welcome to the 34th annual magic show” Everyone was really excited and applauded. First off an old lady came on the stage and started playing the piano. After the old lady played the piano, she called a young girl on the stage. She brought out a magic box. Get in, she said to the young girl rudely.        The young girl, Hannah was offended but silently got in the box. The old lady just shut the door on her face. She said some stuff and opened the box again. She had disappeared. The girl’s mom screamed in horror. The old lady just ignored her and kept going. The audience got uncomfortable but did not say anything. The old lady’s next magic trick was that she locked all the doors to go out. Some people realized and started screaming on top of their lungs.</p>

Those 10 people were young kids who were excited to see what would happen. She puts them in a cage and makes the cage disappear. The parents were screaming. At last the old lady made herself disappear and everyone had been locked inside without a network and without their kids. </p>

       <p>I was fast asleep on Christmas Eve, when suddenly the loud bark of my dog, Archie, woke me up. She was staring directly out my bedroom window. Archie pointed with her dirty paw at the house right in front of ours. “What happened archie? I asked her as I got out of my bed and turned off my led lights. She barked as loud as she could. “Archie, stop barking.” I looked at the window just to see police cars all around the neighborhood. I quickly made my bed and ran downstairs. I did not go outside but I saw what was happening from my glass door. I was too scared to go outside. A chill went down my spine. I went back upstairs and brushed my teeth. Suddenly, I heard something fall. I ran upstairs to check. It was just my book.</p>
       <center>   <img src="christmas.png" height="200"></center> 
       <p> I had decorated my christmas tree beautifully but this year I was sure that christmas is not going to be the best day. My day started with cops. I loved Christmas and I loved celebrating Christmas with my family but for the last 2 years the most I could do is video call because of covid. This year my family had planned an online Christmas “dinner.”

    I work as a cardiologist at a well known hospital. I have to work 6 days a week. I changed into my doctor outfit and hugged Archie and left. As I walked down my neighborhood I saw an old lady talking to the cop. “I hope it is nothing serious” I thought to myself as I unlocked my car. I sat in and drove to my hospital. After a long day of work, around 10 pm I got a new patient who just had a heart attack. As I walked into the operation theater, I recognized the lady. She was the lady who was talking to the cop.I performed the surgery successfully but we needed to keep her in the ICU. Right after that,I left the hospital.</p>

        I reached and walked up the hill to my house just to see cop cars in front of my house. I stood right in front of the house, that's when Archie started barking really loud. I ignored archie. “There has been a missing person case. Jack was last seen yesterday night with his friends at a party. He is a 20 years old man and I am pretty sure you have seen him,” said the cop in a quite confident voice. “I indeed have seen him but I did not see him yesterday or today. I am sorry, if I see something suspicious I will let you know.” I said, The cops drove away and I entered my house.</p>
        <center>   <img src="copcar.png" height="200"></center> 
        <p>I changed into my normal clothes and got ready to sleep. I went upstairs and did my skincare routine. After that I immediately went to sleep. This Christmas was not a normal christmas. No present, no fun, nothing. I woke up around 9 am. Today was a holiday. I did not have to go to my hospital. I changed my outfit and looked out of my window just to see a 10 year old kid standing right in front of my house.</p>
